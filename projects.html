                        This RnD project analyses the performance of MultiVersX, a live-sharded blockchain system to measure the network's throughput, scalability, vulnerabilities and efficiency (of cross-shard communication). It uses the local testnet provided by MultiVersX and Python scripts (Developed from scratch) for a detailed analysis.

                        Auto grading-Server Project focused on developing a server for grading C++ programs. The primary objective was implementing various server architectures, including single-threaded, multi-threaded (with and without a thread pool), and asynchronous versions. A client-side application was also developed to facilitate the submission of C++ programs for grading.

                        This project involves creating a custom hypervisor using KVM on Linux to manage virtual machines (VMs). The project includes building a basic VM from scratch, implementing hypercalls for guest OS interactions, and designing a scheduler to manage multiple VMs with fractional time allocation. The primary focus is on understanding x86 hardware virtualization and controlling VM execution using KVM APIs and signals.
