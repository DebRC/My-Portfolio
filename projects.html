            <p>
              This RnD project analyses the performance of MultiVersX, a live-sharded blockchain system to measure the
              network's throughput, scalability, vulnerabilities and efficiency (of cross-shard communication). It uses
              the local testnet provided by MultiVersX and Python scripts (Developed from scratch) for a detailed analysis.

              <p>
                A Survey on Scaling Blockchain using Sharding. It is done under the guidance of Prof. Vinay Ribeiro as a
                part of course CS694 (Seminar). Carried out a comparative analysis of various protocols like RapidChain,
                Elastico, Omniledger, GearBox, Reticulum e.t.c. considering parameters such as throughput, cross-shard
                performance, security and efficiency.

                Auto grading-Server Project focused on developing a server for
                grading C++ programs. The primary objective was implementing various
                server architectures, including single-threaded, multi-threaded
                (with and without a thread pool), and asynchronous versions. A
                client-side application was also developed to facilitate the
                submission of C++ programs for grading.

              <p>
                This project involves creating a custom hypervisor using KVM on
            Linux to manage virtual machines (VMs). The project includes
            building a basic VM from scratch, implementing hypercalls for guest
            OS interactions, and designing a scheduler to manage multiple VMs
            with fractional time allocation. The primary focus is on
            understanding x86 hardware virtualization and controlling VM
            execution using KVM APIs and signals.
